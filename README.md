# About Project

This project analyzes sales, inventory, product, and store data for a multi-location retail chain specializing in toys, games, and art & crafts. The goal is to solve key business challenges such as stockouts, overstocking, profitability tracking, and store performance monitoring. 

Using four key datasets â€” Sales, Products, Inventory, and Stores â€” the project delivers data-driven insights and actionable recommendations.
Key Objectives: 
* **Inventory Optimization**: Identify low-stock and overstock situations to minimize missed sales opportunities and reduce excess inventory costs.
* **Sales Performance Analysis:** Track top-selling products, categories, and regional trends to optimize marketing and stocking strategies.
* **Profitability Insights:** Calculate product-level and category-level profit margins to focus on high-value items.
* **Store Performance Monitoring:** Compare stores by revenue, profit, and operational metrics to identify underperforming locations and growth opportunities.
